# NodeJS

This repository hosts projects focused on exploring the features of the NodeJS and Backend in general. Each project uses a different approach to implement applications which helps in better understanding of the backend development.

## [Songs API](tune-filter/README.md)

This Node.js project processes music track data from a Spotify CSV file. It efficiently parses CSV data to extract relevant information about tracks and organizes it by artist. Additionally, it offers an RESTful API with endpoints for viewing and downloading this data, as well as for retrieving artist-specific information such as songs, playlists, and albums. Utilizing EJS templates for server-side rendering and following the MVC architecture, the project ensures efficient code organization and maintainability.
